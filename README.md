d-is-for-delete
==========

This is forked initially to keep a copy of vim mapping to make 'd' delete (not cut). However, this has evolved into my personal store of configs for other things as well

# Usage

## vim
```
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ducmtran/d-is-for-delete/master/.vimrc >> ~/.vimrc 
```

## nvim
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ducmtran/d-is-for-delete/master/init.vim >> ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

## ideavimrc:
```
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ducmtran/d-is-for-delete/master/ideavimrc >> ~/.ideavimrc
```
